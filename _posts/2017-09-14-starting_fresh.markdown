My wife and I have lived all over and moved many times for my job or hers at different points in our time together. Since we met (5 years ago) we have lived in Maine, Massachusettes, Texas, California, New York and now Connecticut. The moves have come because of jobs, my jobs for the most part. I have been a Strength and Conditioning Coach since graduating in 2009. The profession has allowed me to experience amazing opportunities including: working as a strength coach wtih US Tennis training all the US professional players and also as a strength coach with the New York Giants of the NFL. While the experiences have been great, the job security and lack of jobs has made it a tough profession to be a part of. 

A few months back we found out my wife was pregnant which brought a lot of excitment but also a lot of new considerations. One big consideration is my profession. With a family it's a lot tougher to move around all the time and never know where you will be each year. With that realization I knew it was time for a change. My wife and I sat down and talked about possible options based off things I enjoy. We both agreed that I love computers and am always on mine and that is where we found a starting point. From there I really thought into and realized that I have always found programs and everything that runs through/ on a computer to be amazing. I have dabbled here and there in coding in the past but never had an actual guideline to follow which made it tough for me to continue to learn while working full time as well. Once I decided that was the route, I found Flatiron Online program which would give me the flexibility and guidance I need to help me progress and grow into a developer. 

I'm looking forward to the future with this new found career option and am exicted aout what I have learned and will continue to learn and hope to make this my life. A life that not only can challenge me but also bring out the best in me. Outside of the profession itself, it can also bring stability to my growing family.
