I've been working through the Flatiron courses for 2 months now and every day I've learned something new and progressed. Some lessons I fly through while others cause a lot of frustration but either way the end result is the same: I complete it and hae a new understanding of code. 
A few of the labs have taken me a while to complete and once in a while it's because of something as simple as an extra " " where it doesn't belong. No matter what the obstacle was in each lab, I always make sure to never move on until I realize exactly why what I was doing wasn't working. 
I still have a long road ahead of me but I'm happy with the progress and understanding I have made throughout each lesson and look forward to more to come.
