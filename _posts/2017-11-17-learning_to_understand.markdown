At the start of this journey I was reading through the README of each project/lab and essentially going through the motions to get each test to pass. The further down the road I got, I realized I wasn't atually learning anything but rather reading just enough to get by. During some of the OO lessons I struggled at times to work through problems when they weren't clear. This was when it all clicked... I haven't been fully grasping all the concepts and truly understanding what I was learning. It took me a minute to accept this fact and since then things have been so much better and so muh more fullfilling. Before I move on from each reading, lab or assisgnment, I amke sure that I understand EXACTLY what is happening within each line of code written. I make sure to know the exact reason why it's what I'm writing and why it wouldn't be something else. By doing so I have gained a whole new level of appreciateion for the coding world and it has really opened my eyes to so much more.
