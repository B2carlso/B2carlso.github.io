Throughout this coding journey I have found my biggest set back is overthinking. During self practice, labs and lessons I often run into an error, an error that sadly I can't always figure out by reading the message given. Over and over again I go through my code searching for some big mistake: wrong execution, writing coe in the wrong method, etc... After seconds, minutes and sometimes even longer, I find myself wanting to gouge out my eyes as I can't find the big mistake I made to make it an executable program. Sometimes I have asked the Learn community for help, sometimes after what seems like an eternity of head scratching, I find the reason for the error. The so often SIMPLE reason for the errors. A letter that should be capitalized, an "s" at the end of the word where it shouldn't be, spelling a word wrong. So often it is the simplest of mistakes that cause the error and my overthinking that causes the frustration. I'm learning to take a step back and really read through the code, read through everything and don't always look for the big mistake. Not everything is so complex in this world so don't try to make it so.
